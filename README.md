TunaEye is a **CNN-based computer vision** kiosk for yellowfin tuna. It supports expert graders by classifying **sashibo core** and **tail-cut** images — it does not take the grader's place.

Expert-annotated data, standardized capture, and transfer learning make grading more consistent, faster, and easier to share. The human remains the authority.

## What you get

| Surface | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Public landing** | Brand, install, station story |
| **Kiosk PWA** | Capture → infer → review → receipt |
| **Admin** | Records, prices, graders, devices, audit |
| **Pi edge** | Grade + confidence over LAN |
| **Cloud** | Supabase records + evidence when configured |

## Run

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` then `npm run preview` | Production build |
| `npx vercel` | HTTPS deploy (`dist` + SPA fallback) |

Camera and PWA install need **HTTPS** or **localhost**.

## Grade a fish

```text
1  Expert grader          5  Align + capture
2  Name                   6  Pi inference
3  Sashibo / tail / both  7  Review or override
4  Weight (max 200 kg)    8  Print receipt
```

Same-fish vs different-fish is asked when both cuts are selected. After **two sessions in 30 minutes**, that grader skips the placement tutorial. **Grade another** keeps the grader and returns to sample select.

## Station notes

<p>
<img src="public/assets/mobile%20app%20qr.png" width="140" align="right" alt="Install QR" />
</p>

- **Install** — landing QR, or browser **Install app / Add to Home Screen**
- **Cameras** — lists every device camera; allow permission, then reload if blocked
- **Admin PIN** — `1234` (change before production)
- **Overrides** — PIN-gated; original model confidence is kept
- **Print** — 80 mm receipt layout via the OS print dialog
- **Offline** — JPEG evidence in IndexedDB; metadata local until sync

## Repo map

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/MarketingLanding.tsx` | Public site |
| `src/App.tsx` | Kiosk workflow |
| `src/kioskState.ts` | Session reducer |
| `public/` | PWA, icons, samples, install QR |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Pi / cloud contracts |
| `FEATURES.md` | Feature inventory |

Without Pi or cloud credentials, records stay on the device with a retryable sync state. Phone clients must use the same Supabase project as `docs/SHARED_SUPABASE_CONTRACT.md`.
